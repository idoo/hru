At HRUApp, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app. Our goal is to keep things simple and transparent.

## Information We Collect
HRUApp is designed to send you daily mood check-in notifications. To do this:  
- **Notification Permissions:** We request permission to send you notifications. This is required for the app to work and remind you each day.  
- **No Personal Data:** We don’t collect your name, email, location, or any specific details about your mood or day unless you choose to share them elsewhere (e.g., in a future feature).  
- **Device Information:** We may access basic device data (e.g., iOS version) to ensure the app runs smoothly, but this isn’t tied to you personally.

## How We Use Your Information
- **Notifications:** We use your permission to schedule and deliver the daily “How was your day?” reminder.  
- **App Functionality:** Any basic data helps us keep the app working as intended.  
- We don’t sell, share, or trade your information with anyone. Period.

## Data Storage and Security
- **Local Storage:** Notification settings are stored on your device, not on our servers.  
- **No Cloud Collection:** As of now, HRUApp doesn’t send data to external servers or store it remotely.  
- We take reasonable steps to protect the app, but no system is 100% secure. If that changes, we’ll update this policy.

## Third Parties
HRUApp doesn’t share your data with third parties. If we add features (like analytics or cloud backups) in the future, we’ll let you know and update this policy accordingly.

## Your Choices
- **Notifications:** You can turn off notifications anytime in your device settings. If you do, the app won’t remind you, but you can still open it manually.  
- **Uninstall:** Don’t want the app anymore? Just delete it—any permissions or settings go with it.

## Children’s Privacy
HRUApp isn’t designed for kids under 13. We don’t knowingly collect data from children. If you’re a parent and think we’ve slipped up, contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Policy
We might update this policy if the app changes (e.g., new features). We’ll notify you via the app or this page. Check back here for the latest version.
